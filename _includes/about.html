                  <p>The objective of this book is to answer to the most significant question that developers encounter while learning or working with F#.</p>
<p>How can I build a <strong>real-world</strong>, <strong>production-ready</strong>, <strong>end-to-end</strong> application in <strong>F#</strong> using the <strong>functional programming principles</strong>?</p>
<p>Immutability, Type Safety, Pattern Matching, Pure Functions and all other functional programming things sound good on paper but How can I build something useful by applying it?</p>
<p>This book has been created exclusively to answer these questions in a developer-friendly way!</p>
<p>Sounds interesting?</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s have a look at what we will be learning from this book. </p>
